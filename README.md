# BA-Player

A reference to the famour Touhou fanmade [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) and how it seemingly can be played on anything that can have a change of state.

A personal project to see what screens are projectable, no matter how unconventional.

This project will be mostly powered by Python, since it's the easiest to use as a proof of functionality. Perhaps with a more complete form in the future, could try converting to other languages

## Usage

Firstly, be sure to have Python installed and running. Currently using **Python Version 3.11**
Run with:
> python player.py [player option] [filename]

## Current Valid Media

Slowly will develop to display a video onto various mediums, and to a varying range of outputs.

- Terminal
- Notepad (Win11, unsure about other OS)
